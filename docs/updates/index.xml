      <description>The website for the Location Tracking, Contact Tracing, and Geospatial Privacy of COVID-19 project is now live. The Project GitHub Repository is also available. We will soon be adding a range of project materials to that site.
Our work is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation Award BCS-2032203. We hope the data and publications contained here will contribute to an informed public debate about the role DCTT can play during different phases of the pandemic.</description>
