      <description>Since our previous update, we have seen the number of states who have either released or are planning to release a digital contract tracing (DCT) app increase from 7 to 17. A common trend has been the increase in the number of Bluetooth-based apps.
Even states that had previously used GPS-based DCT apps (e.g. North Dakota and Wyoming) are switching to Bluetooth, citing privacy concerns. It was also recently announced that Apple and Google were going to streamline their digital tracking framework, making it easier for states to develop their own app.</description>

      <description>The website for the Location Tracking, Contact Tracing, and Geospatial Privacy of COVID-19 project is now live. The Project GitHub Repository is also available. We will soon be adding a range of project materials to that site.
Our work is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation Award BCS-2032203. We hope the data and publications contained here will contribute to an informed public debate about the role DCTT can play during different phases of the pandemic.</description>
