      <description>The pre-print of our forthcoming chapter Assessing Connections and Tradeoffs between Geosaptial Data Ethics, Privacy, and the Effectiveness of Digital Contact Tracing Technologies is available through the Location Tracking, Contact Tracing, and Geospatial Privacy During COVID-9 GitHub page.
In that pre-print Peter Kedron and Andrew Trgovac examines contact tracing, its potential extension using geospatial technologies, and the tradeoffs between privacy and effectiveness that may arise as these systems are developed and deployed to address COVID-19.</description>

      <title>September Update to Status of State DCTTs</title>

      <description>Since our previous update, we have seen the number of states who have either released or are planning to release a digital contract tracing (DCT) app increase from 7 to 17. A common trend has been the increase in the number of Bluetooth-based apps.
Even states that had previously used GPS-based DCT apps (e.g. North Dakota and Wyoming) are switching to Bluetooth, citing privacy concerns. It was also recently announced that Apple and Google were going to streamline their digital tracking framework, making it easier for states to develop their own app.</description>

      <description>Many, many thanks to our departing undergraduate summer interns - Roxane Avalos, Ricardo Charcas, Juan Mancillas, Daniel Spalla, Taylor The, and Brandon Wolff. Your diligence and persistence in tracking down information about DCTT around the country this summer were critical to the project. We wish you all the best and look forward to collaborating with all of you in the future.</description>

      <description>The website for the Location Tracking, Contact Tracing, and Geospatial Privacy of COVID-19 project is now live. The Project GitHub Repository is also available. We will soon be adding a range of project materials to that site.
Our work is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation Award BCS-2032203. We hope the data and publications contained here will contribute to an informed public debate about the role DCTT can play during different phases of the pandemic.</description>
