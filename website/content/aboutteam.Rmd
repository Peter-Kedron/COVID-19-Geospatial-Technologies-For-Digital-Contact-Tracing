**Dr. Peter Kedron**

*Assistant Professor of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State University*

Peter is a geographer and social scientist working at the intersection of spatial analysis,
geographic information science (GIScience), and economic geography. His research program
develops the methodological tools and analytical frameworks needed to uncover the causes of
geographic phenomena, and, through the application of those innovations, he advances
understandings of the interactions between humans and their natural and social environments.

**Dr. Andrew B. Trgovac**

*Instructor of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State University*

Drew is a biogeographer who utilizes geographic information science to identify patterns of
species abundance in historic and present-day ecosystems. Additionally, he has worked in the
field of spatial epidemiology examining the spatial pattern of causal variables linked to male
suicide rates in the United States.

**Roxane Avalos**

*Undergraduate in the Department of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State
University*

Roxane is an undergraduate majoring in Geographic Information Science at Arizona State
University. When not involved in course work or research programs, she enjoys all aspects of
gardening and has even ventured into aquaculture. Her primary role in the project has been data
collection from state health agencies.

**Ricardo Charcas**

*Undergraduate in the Department of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State
University*

Ricardo is a senior pursuing a degree in Urban Planning with a certificate in Geographic
Information Science. His interests include studying geospatial data and applying GIS to
municipal and regional planning. His primary role in this project has been to research the
technology used by location tracking apps and to help to build a database of digital contact
tracing programs being implemented nationwide.

**Juan Mancillas**

*Undergraduate in the Department of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State
University*

Juan is a senior pursuing a degree in Geographic Information Science and Geography at ASU.
One of his areas of interest is examining the spatial structure of human and social issues. His
primary role in the project is to research and investigate different forms of digital contact tracing
various states are implementing to help them in their fight against COVID-19.

**Daniel Spalla**

*Undergraduate in the Department of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State
University*

Dan first used a computer when he was two years old and has been writing software for half of
his life. Currently, he is pursuing a degree in Geographic Information Science. His primary
responsibilities for the project are software development, digital mapping, and writing technical
documentation.

**Andrew Solis**

*Undergraduate in the Department of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State
University*

Andrew is a senior pursuing degrees in Conservation Biology and Geographic Information Science. His areas of interest include the use of GIS and GPS technologies in public health as well as species and landscape restoration. Outside of studies, he is also interested in flight and aviation. Andrew's primary role for the project is collecting data on the deployment of contact tracing technologies by state and local health authorities.

**Taylor The**

*Undergraduate in the Department of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State
University*

Taylor is passionate about exploring how machine learning and AI could expand and advance
GIS processes and analysis in the modern day and future.  To that end, Taylor is pursuing a
degree in Geographic Information Science at Arizona State University. His primary role on the
project is to collect relevant general and technological data for various contact tracing mobile
applications along with cataloging the information for further evaluation.

**Brandon Wolff**

*Undergraduate in the Department of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State
University*

Brandon is a senior pursuing a degree in Urban Planning, with a minor in Sustainability, at
Arizona State University. He is professionally focused on creating and improving development
and growth that is community-focused, equitable, healthy, and multigeneration sustainable.
His primary role on the project is communicating with states about their responses to the Covid-
19 pandemic through the application of various contact tracing techniques.
