<strong>Dr. Peter Kedron</strong></p>
<p><em>Assistant Professor of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State University</em></p>
<p>Peter is a geographer and social scientist working at the intersection of spatial analysis,
geographic information science (GIScience), and economic geography. His research program
develops the methodological tools and analytical frameworks needed to uncover the causes of
geographic phenomena, and, through the application of those innovations, he advances
understandings of the interactions between humans and their natural and social environments.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Andrew B. Trgovac</strong></p>
<p><em>Instructor of Geography and Urban Planning at Arizona State University</em></p>
<p>Drew is a biogeographer who utilizes geographic information science to identify patterns of
species abundance in historic and present-day ecosystems. Additionally, he has worked in the
field of spatial epidemiology examining the spatial pattern of causal variables linked to male
suicide rates in the United States.</p>
