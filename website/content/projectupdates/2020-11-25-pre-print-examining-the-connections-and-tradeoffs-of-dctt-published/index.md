The pre-print of our forthcoming chapter **Assessing Connections and Tradeoffs between Geosaptial Data Ethics, Privacy, and the Effectiveness of Digital Contact Tracing Technologies** is available through the [Location Tracking, Contact Tracing, and Geospatial Privacy During COVID-9](https://github.com/Peter-Kedron/COVID-19-Geospatial-Technologies-For-Digital-Contact-Tracing) GitHub page. 

In that pre-print **Peter Kedron** and **Andrew Trgovac** examines contact tracing, its potential extension using geospatial technologies, and the tradeoffs between privacy and effectiveness that may arise as these systems are developed and deployed to address COVID-19. By identifying linkages between the potential capabilities of these technologies and ethical and privacy principles of geospatial data handling, we introduce a framework for assessing conflicts between privacy and effectiveness.
