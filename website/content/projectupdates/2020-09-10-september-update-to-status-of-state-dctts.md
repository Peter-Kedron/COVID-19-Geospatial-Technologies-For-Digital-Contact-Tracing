Since our previous update, we have seen the number of states who have either released or are planning to release a digital contract tracing (DCT) app increase from 7 to 17.  A common trend has been the increase in the number of Bluetooth-based apps.  

Even states that had previously used GPS-based DCT apps (e.g. North Dakota and Wyoming) are switching to Bluetooth, citing privacy concerns.  It was also recently announced that Apple and Google were going to streamline their digital tracking framework, [making it easier for states to develop their own app](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/technology/apple-google-virus-alert-technology.html).  For states not wishing to create an app, the [Apple/Google framework could still be used](https://www.wired.com/story/google-apple-change-tactics-contact-tracing-tech/).  Apple is integrating this system into their iOS while Google will have apps available for states opting into the system.  [Colorado, the first state to launch the EN Express app](https://gazette.com/health/colorado-could-be-first-in-us-to-launch-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-with-apple-google/article_61c537de-f2c0-11ea-938e-eff56cac73fa.html), will have it available to the public by the end of September.
