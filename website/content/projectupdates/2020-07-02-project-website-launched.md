The website for the **Location Tracking, Contact Tracing, and Geospatial Privacy of COVID-19** project is now live. The [Project GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Peter-Kedron/COVID-19-Geospatial-Technologies-For-Digital-Contact-Tracing) is also available.  We will soon be adding a range of project materials to that site.  

Our work is funded by the  [U.S. National Science Foundation Award BCS-2032203](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2032203). We hope the data and publications contained here will contribute to an informed public debate about the role DCTT can play during different phases of the pandemic.
